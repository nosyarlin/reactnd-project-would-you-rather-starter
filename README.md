# Would You Rather Project
This is a simple react project for playing the "Would You Rather" game. There are
three users hardcoded into the code (since this project is purely front end and
does not have a supporting backend). You can pick any one of the hardcoded users
to play the game. 

## Getting Started
Just clone the project and run `yarn start`

## Features
* Login page where you can choose to be any user
* Home page where you can view answered and unanswered questions
* Leaderboard where users are ranked by how many questions they have asked and 
answered
* Users can add new questions
